In this repository there is a colletion of my personal [yasnippet](http://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet)
snippets for many different Emacs modes.  This is a rip-fork from https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets with some
of my own extensions.

Credit goes to all original authors of the respective snippets.
